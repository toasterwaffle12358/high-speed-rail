                    A train is the ultimate carpool. <br>
                    A typical car releases 4.6 metric tons of CO2 EVERY YEAR.
                    In contrast to this, high speed rail runs on electricity.
                    Ideally the energy grid would be using renewable sources,
                    but even if it isnt, high speed rail will still be more 
                    effecient due to grouping many people into one vehicle.
                    Even though high speed rail isnt taking CO2 out of the atmosphere,
                    it still helps prevent more going in.

                    Many ways to slow climate change involve giving up something, 
                    like giving up meat, or reducing your energy usage. High speed 
                    rail would only better the lives of those using it. High speed rail
                    could make travels faster and more enjoyable. Instead of paying attention 
                    to the road for hours, you could read a book, or work on a hobby.

                    High speed rail could be implimented in many places around the world.
                    Some countries around the world already use it! Japan and many parts of Europe 
                    already have advanced high speed rail networks. In Europe you can get to entirely 
                    different countries without having to drive at all, and more is planned. However, like others, high speed rail is an
                    expensive solution and many poorer countries could not afford to impliment it without help. <br>

                    Funding from big oil and the car industry has kept America in a car dependant state
                    for a long time. Our public transit is horrible compared to other
                    countries and parking lots take up our land. High speed rail is not just
                    about climate change, but is also the start of a big shift away from cars,
                    and towards public transit.

                I chose high speed rail because public transit and non car based infrastructure really interest me. even outside of climate change, I think investing
                more resources in our public transit system is important. at a large level indevidual carbon footprint is not as important as it is made out to be, but 
                changing how you commute to work or school every day for every person could have massive positive effects on global climate change. I also think with so
                many other countries using high speed rail already, we know its something that is tested and works.
